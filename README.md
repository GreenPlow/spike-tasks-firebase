# spike-tasks-firebase
This is a responsive app I wrote that utilizes reactjs, react-bootstrap, and firebase to assign tasks to different days and assign a t-shirt size.

# local development
Start the app locally with `npm start`.

# eslint
To use eslint ensure your node packages have the necessary peerdeps. The airbnb styleguide is utilized.
See the package.json for linting and other commands. Note that eslint must be told to lint .jsx files.
